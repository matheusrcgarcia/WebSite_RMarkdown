title: "SQL Data Exploration"
description: |
  For this beginner-mid level project I used a Covid dataset as my base to use queries to explore the information that the dataset contains. Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Importing Libraries 

```{r Connections}
library(RODBC)
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
#conn1 <- odbcConnect("SQLServer_DSN")
#sqlQuery(conn1, "Select * from covid_death")
```

# Establishing Connection

In order to use SQL databases, you must establish connection with Microsoft SQL Server. One way to do that, is using "dbConnect":

```{r}
conn2 <- dbConnect(odbc:: odbc(),"SQLServer_DSN" )
```

# First View

Let's take a first look into our data:

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="firstview1"}
SELECT * 
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3,4
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(firstview1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

# Data Exploration

## Selecting Data

Select the data the we are going to be starting with

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="selectdata1"}
SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(selectdata1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- We can see on page 2, that in Afghanistan, the first death started approximately one month after the first confirmed case. After this date, the number of deaths ramps a lot. 


## Looking at Total Cases Vs Total Deaths

How many cases there is in this country and how many deaths they have per the total number of cases (in percentage). I can say that this shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country. For this example I will use "Brazil" as the country that will be looking. 

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="lookdata1"}
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE location LIKE '%Brazil%'
AND continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 1,2
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(lookdata1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- We can see on the last page, that the Death Percentage in Brazil on 2022/02/28 is approximately **2.25%**.


## Total Cases vs Population 

Shows what percentage of population that was infected with Covid in Brazil.

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="infecdata1"}
SELECT location, date, Population, total_cases,  ROUND((total_cases/population),5)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE location LIKE '%Brazil%'
AND continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 1,2
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(infecdata1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- We can see on page 15 that on 2020/07/20, Brazil had almost **1%** of their whole population infected by Covid.


## Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population


```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="contryhigh1"}
SELECT location, Population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount,  MAX(ROUND((total_cases/population),4))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(contryhigh1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- Right on the first page, we can see that the country with the highest percent of his population infect is Faeroe Islands with almost **70%**.

## Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="contrydeath1"}
SELECT location, Population, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location, Population
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(contrydeath1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- The country with the highest death county in the whole world is *United States*, with 9504900 deaths. Even with a very large population, we can compare the *indian* results. *India*, even with a larger population than US, the number of deaths was smaller. 

## Breaking things down by Continent

```{sql connection=conn2, include=FALSE, output.var="contdeath1"}
SELECT continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(contdeath1, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 5))
```

- We can see that the continent with the highest number of deaths is *North America*, followed by *South America* and *Asia*. 


## GLOBAL NUMBERS

```{sql connection=conn2}
SELECT SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death"
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2
```


- The death percentage in the whole world is almost *1.37%* by Covid.

## Total Population vs Vaccinations

Shows Percentage of Population that has received at least one Covid Vaccine, during the pandemic. 

```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="vac11"}
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS float)) OVER (Partition BY dea.Location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.Date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_death" dea
JOIN "Portfolio"."dbo"."covid_vaccinations" vac
	ON dea.location = vac.location
	AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
AND dea.location LIKE '%Brazil%' 
ORDER BY 2,3
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(vac11, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 6))
```

- We can see that the first vaccination in Brazil happened only in 2021/01/18.
- Because we can not use the column that we just created to perform operation in SQL, we need to CTE or Temp Tables. So let's start with the first one: 


## CTE

Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query


```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="vac21"}
With PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS float)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From Portfolio..covid_death dea
Join Portfolio..covid_vaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null 
AND dea.location like '%Brazil%'
)
Select *, ROUND((RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population),6)*100 AS PercentagePopVaccinated
From PopvsVac
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(vac21, options = list(rows.print = 10, cols.print = 7))
```

- We can see in the last column the the percentage of population in Brazil that is vaccinated is *18.19%*.


## Temp Table

Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query


```{sql connection=conn2, output.var="vac31"}
DROP Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
Continent nvarchar(255),
Location nvarchar(255),
Date datetime,
Population numeric,
New_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

Insert into #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS float)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From Portfolio..covid_death dea
Join Portfolio..covid_vaccinations vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date

Select *, ROUND((RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population),4)*100 AS PctPopVacOverTime
From #PercentPopulationVaccinated
Where continent is not null 
AND location like '%states%'
```

- Due limitation in *R Markdown*, I can not create a Temp Table. But to show that this code above works, I run in Microsoft SQL Server and this is the result:
